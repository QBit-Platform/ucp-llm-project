üåü Abstract & Project Vision

The User Context Protocol for Large Language Models (UCP-LLM) project introduces an innovative framework and a developing suite of tools aimed at establishing a profound, nuanced, and persistent contextual understanding between a human user and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Moving beyond the limitations of superficial instructions or transient system prompts, UCP-LLM endeavors to empower LLMs to achieve a significant degree of "intellectual alignment" with the user's intricate cognitive framework, core values, established methodologies, and overarching goals. This initiative is driven by the vision of transforming LLMs from passive informational utilities into dynamic, insightful, and synergistic "cognitive partners."

This repository documents the conceptual architecture of such a protocol and presents the evolution of tools designed to generate, manage, and utilize these user-specific context files, culminating in the current "Eve Edition" which introduces a more interactive and guided approach to protocol creation.

üéØ The Problem Addressed by UCP-LLM

Contemporary methods for tailoring LLM interactions, such as system prompts or basic custom instructions, often prove insufficient in several critical areas:

Depth of Understanding: Failing to establish a comprehensive, multi-faceted understanding of the user's unique intellectual and personal landscape.

Contextual Persistence: Struggling to maintain consistent context over prolonged or multiple interaction sessions, leading to a "cold start" problem or loss of nuanced understanding.

Alignment with User Frameworks: Difficulty in aligning with the user's specific intellectual paradigms, ethical standpoints, and methodological preferences.

Adaptability to Specifics: Limited capacity to adapt to user-specific projects, evolving goals, and idiosyncratic terminologies or conceptual definitions.

UCP-LLM directly confronts these limitations by proposing and implementing a structured, rich, and dynamically updatable protocol that serves as a persistent "cognitive fingerprint" of the user.

‚ú® Core Features & Innovations of the UCP-LLM Framework

The UCP-LLM framework is characterized by several key innovations:

Structured Semantic Protocol: Defines a comprehensive schema –Ω–æ—É—Ç–±—É–∫ (schema) with distinct, logically organized sections. These cover personal data, intellectual identity (core thinking references, cognitive passions), ethical value systems, ongoing projects and objectives, user-defined conceptual tunings (custom terminology), preferred interaction styles, desired LLM persona, and more.

Deep Contextualization & Nuance: Moves beyond surface-level preferences to capture and articulate the user's fundamental thinking references, cognitive patterns, research methodologies, and hierarchical value systems.

User-Defined Terminology & Conceptual Tuning: Empowers users to define their specialized terms, concepts, and their unique interpretations, ensuring the LLM comprehends and utilizes them with precision.

Dynamic & Evolvable "Living Document": The protocol is conceived as a dynamic entity, capable of evolving in tandem with the user's intellectual growth, project developments, and shifting priorities.

Tool-Assisted Generation & Management: The project includes progressively sophisticated tools to facilitate the creation, editing, and programmatic utilization of UCP-LLM files.

"Eve" - The Semi-Intelligent Assistant (v1.1.0): Introduces an interactive, conversational AI persona designed to guide users through the protocol creation process, offering templates, reminders, and a more engaging experience. Eve is envisioned as a component with significant potential for future machine learning enhancements.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Evolution & Current Components: Version 1.0.0 vs. Version 1.1.0 (Eve Edition)

The project has evolved significantly from its initial conception. Below is a comparison highlighting the key advancements:

Version 1.0.0: Foundational Toolset (Primarily Arabic UI)

This initial version laid the groundwork for the UCP-LLM concept, focusing on enabling users to manually construct their protocols.

Core Components:

Conceptual Protocol Document: A detailed text document outlining the UCP-LLM structure (initially in Arabic and English).

UCP-LLM Generator (v2.6) (HTML Tool - Arabic UI):

A browser-based tool allowing users to manually fill form fields corresponding to protocol sections.

Primarily featured an Arabic user interface.

Exported protocols as structured JSON (with English keys for interoperability) and a formatted TXT preview.

Included auto-save to browser local storage.

ucp_llm (Python Library v1.0.0):

A foundational Python library for parsing and accessing data from the UCP-LLM JSON files (expecting English keys).

Provided getter methods for various protocol sections.

UCP-LLM Profile Manager (Python Tkinter GUI v1.0.0):

A desktop GUI application for loading, viewing, editing (values only), and saving UCP-LLM JSON files, and exporting to TXT. Utilized English labels for display.

Key Achievements of v1.0.0:

Established the core UCP-LLM framework and its comprehensive sectional structure.

Provided a functional, albeit manual, method for protocol generation.

Introduced machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (TXT) export formats.

Demonstrated the viability of a client-side HTML tool for this purpose.

Version 1.1.0: Eve Edition (Enhanced & English UI)

This version represents a significant leap forward, primarily through the introduction of "Eve" and a complete UI localization to English, alongside numerous refinements.

Core Components (Updated):

Conceptual Protocol Document: Remains a guiding document, with practical implementation refined in the tools.

UCP-LLM Generator with Eve (v1.1.0) (HTML Tool - English UI):

(Located in /ucp_llm_generator/UCP_LLM_Generator_EN_1.1.0.html - or the latest named file)

Major Enhancement: "Eve" AI Assistant:

Provides an interactive, conversational interface for guided protocol creation.

Operates in multiple modes:

Fullscreen Immersive Mode: For focused, distraction-free interaction with Eve.

Side Panel Mode: Allows Eve to assist alongside the traditional manual form interface.

Semi-Intelligent Features:

Offers template suggestions for certain fields (e.g., ethical values, project goals) to expedite input.

Provides intelligent reminders about important, unfilled sections upon reopening a session.

Delivers time-based greetings for a more personalized touch.

Features an expanded set of creative/probing questions to elicit deeper contextual insights, with answers stored in "Additional General Notes."

User Interface & Experience Overhaul:

Complete localization to English for all UI elements, messages, and help content.

Sophisticated layout management dynamically adjusting to Eve's panel presence and position (left/right, user-configurable and saved).

Enhanced protocol preview modal accessible from Eve's panel, featuring "Copy to Clipboard" and "Save as TXT" functionalities.

Refined Protocol Output (TXT):

The human-readable TXT export now includes instructive sections:

--- How to Use This Protocol? --- (guiding the LLM on leveraging the protocol).

--- Key Points (Quick Summary) --- (dynamically generated summary of crucial information).

Codebase & Robustness Improvements:

Addressed and resolved issues identified in previous iterations (e.g., debouncing mechanisms for Eve's reply processing to prevent duplicate calls).

Improved tooltip display for long template button texts.

Sanitized filenames for exported files (removing invalid characters from version strings).

Enhanced logic for findFirstEmptySection and jumpToSection for smoother navigation in Eve.

More explicit user messaging (e.g., for skipped questions, session completion).

Basic versioning check (console warning) when loading data from a different protocol version.

ucp_llm (Python Library v1.0.0 - largely compatible):

The existing Python library remains compatible as the core JSON structure (English keys) is maintained. Future enhancements to the library could align with new protocol elements or offer more advanced parsing.

UCP-LLM Profile Manager (Python Tkinter GUI v1.0.0 - largely compatible):

Similarly, the Tkinter GUI should remain largely functional for viewing and editing existing fields, as it relies on the ucp_llm library and the stable JSON key structure.

Key Achievements of v1.1.0:

Transformed User Experience: Shifted from a purely manual tool to an interactive, guided, and more engaging protocol creation process with "Eve."

Increased Accessibility: Full English localization broadens the potential user base.

Enhanced Protocol Utility: The TXT output is now more instructive for LLMs.

Improved Robustness and Refinement: Addressed several minor bugs and usability issues, making the tool more polished.

Foundation for Future Intelligence: "Eve" is designed as a "semi-intelligent" component, laying the groundwork for future enhancements incorporating more advanced NLP or machine learning capabilities to make her assistance even more adaptive and insightful.

üî© Expected JSON Structure (v1.1.0)

The UCP-LLM Generator (Eve Edition) produces a JSON file adhering to a consistent structure, essential for programmatic use by the Python library and other potential integrations.

{
  "protocolVersion": "UCP-LLM Generator v1.1.0-eve-EN (English)", // Example version string
  "generationDate": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "personal",         // Unique English ID for the section
      "title": "üë§ Personal Data", // English display title used in the Generator UI
      "items": [                // Array of items; most sections have one, some (e.g., projects) can have multiple
        {
          "preferredName": "User's Value for this field", // English Key
          "dateOfBirth": "User's Value for this field",
          // ... other English keys and their corresponding user-entered values
        }
      ]
    },
    // Example of a multi-item section:
    {
      "id": "projects",
      "title": "üìå Projects & Objectives",
      "items": [
        {
          "projectOrObjectiveTitle": "Project Alpha",
          "projectDetailedGoals": "Goals for Alpha...",
          // ... other fields for Project Alpha
        },
        {
          "projectOrObjectiveTitle": "Objective Beta",
          "projectDetailedGoals": "Details for Beta...",
          // ... other fields for Objective Beta
        }
      ]
    }
    // ... other sections as defined in sectionTypeData ...
  ]
}


Note: The authoritative list of section ids, titles, field labels, and field jsonKeys (used as keys in the JSON items) is defined within the sectionTypeData JavaScript object in the UCP_LLM_Generator_EN_1.1.0.html (or latest version) file. User-entered values can be in any language.

üöÄ Getting Started with v1.1.0 (Eve Edition)

Generate your Protocol with Eve:

Download the latest HTML file (e.g., UCP_LLM_Generator_EN_1.1.0.html) from the /ucp_llm_generator/ directory.

Open it in your preferred modern web browser.

Choose to start with "Eve (Fullscreen)" for an immersive experience or "Eve (Side Panel)" to see the manual forms concurrently.

Interact with Eve, answer her questions, and utilize templates. Alternatively, or in conjunction, use the manual form sections.

Your progress is auto-saved to your browser's local storage.

Use Eve's "Preview Protocol" button to view, copy, or save a TXT version of your protocol at any time.

Once complete, or at any stage, use the main action buttons (visible in Manual Mode or after closing Eve) to "üíæ Export as JSON". This saves your UCP-LLM_Protocol_v1.1.0.json (or similar) file, which is crucial for other tools. You can also export a final TXT version from here.

Manage with Python GUI (Optional):

Ensure you have Python 3 installed (Tkinter is typically included).

Navigate to the /ucp_llm_gui_manager/ directory.

Run the application: python ucp_llm_profile_manager.py.

Use "File > Load Protocol (JSON)" to open your saved JSON file.

View, edit field values, and save changes back to JSON or export as a formatted TXT file.

Utilize with Python Library (For Developers & Advanced Users):

Place ucp_llm.py (from /ucp_llm_library/) in your Python project's path or install it as a package (e.g., via pip if/when published to PyPI).

Import and use the UCPProfile class to load, parse, and programmatically access the data from your UCP-LLM JSON file within your Python applications or experimental setups.

from ucp_llm import UCPProfile # Assuming ucp_llm.py is accessible

try:
    profile = UCPProfile("path/to/your_UCP-LLM_Protocol_v1.1.0.json") # Use the actual filename

    if profile.is_valid():
        print(f"Protocol loaded successfully. Generator Tool Version: {profile.get_generator_tool_version()}")
        print(f"User's Preferred Name: {profile.get_personal_preferred_name()}")

        all_projects = profile.get_all_projects_objectives()
        if all_projects:
            for project_item in all_projects:
                title = profile.get_value_from_item(project_item, 'projectOrObjectiveTitle')
                goals = profile.get_value_from_item(project_item, 'projectDetailedGoals')
                print(f"\nProject/Objective: {title}")
                if goals: print(f"  Goals: {goals[:100]}...") # Print first 100 chars of goals

        # Example: Accessing a specific ethical value
        ethical_values = profile.get_all_ethical_values()
        if ethical_values:
            print(f"\nFirst Ethical Value: {profile.get_value_from_item(ethical_values[0], 'ethicalValueName')}")
    else:
        print(f"Error loading protocol: {profile.get_error()}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Protocol file not found. Please check the path.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
