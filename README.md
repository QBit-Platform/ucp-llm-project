## üåü Overview

The **User Context Protocol for Large Language Models (UCP-LLM)** is an innovative framework and a suite of tools designed to establish a deep, nuanced, and persistent contextual understanding between a human user and Large Language Models (LLMs). Moving beyond superficial instructions, UCP-LLM aims to enable LLMs to achieve a significant level of "intellectual alignment" with the user's cognitive framework, values, methodologies, and goals.

This project provides the conceptual structure for such a protocol and a set of initial tools to generate, manage, and utilize these user-specific context files. The goal is to transform LLMs from mere "tools" into more profound "cognitive partners."

## üéØ The Problem UCP-LLM Solves

Current methods for customizing LLM interactions (like system prompts or basic custom instructions) often fall short in:
*   Establishing a deep, multi-faceted understanding of the user.
*   Maintaining context consistency over extended interactions.
*   Aligning with the user's unique intellectual, ethical, and methodological frameworks.
*   Adapting to the user's specific projects, goals, and terminologies.

UCP-LLM addresses these limitations by providing a structured, comprehensive, and dynamically updatable protocol.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Innovations

*   **Structured Protocol:** Defines distinct sections covering personal data, intellectual identity, ethical values, projects, custom terminology, interaction preferences, and more.
*   **Deep Contextualization:** Goes beyond simple preferences to capture the user's core thinking references, cognitive patterns, and value systems.
*   **User-Defined Terminology:** Allows users to define their own special terms and concepts for the LLM to understand and use correctly.
*   **Dynamic & Evolvable:** The protocol is designed to be a "living document" that can be updated as the user's thoughts and projects evolve.
*   **Tool-Assisted Generation:** Includes tools to facilitate the creation and management of UCP-LLM files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Project Components (v1.0.0)

This repository currently contains the following core components:

1.  **üìÑ UCP-LLM Protocol Template (Conceptual Document):**
    *   A detailed text document (available in English and Arabic in the `/documentation` folder) outlining the structure, sections, fields, and instructions for the LLM embedded within the UCP-LLM. This forms the theoretical basis of the protocol.
    *   *Note: The practical implementation for tool-generated JSON uses English keys as described below.*

2.  **‚öôÔ∏è `UCP-LLM Generator` (HTML Tool):**
    *   **(Located in `/ucp_llm_generator/UCP_LLM Generator.html`)**
    *   A browser-based HTML tool (v1.0.0, previously developed as v2.6 with Arabic UI) with an **English user interface** that allows users to interactively fill out all sections of the UCP-LLM.
    *   **Exports the protocol as a structured JSON file with English keys** (values can be in any language entered by the user).
    *   Also supports exporting a formatted text preview of the protocol.
    *   Features auto-save to local browser storage.
    *   *[Future: Link to a hosted version of the tool will be provided here.]*

3.  **üêç `ucp_llm` (Python Library):**
    *   **(Located in `/ucp_llm_library/ucp_llm.py`)**
    *   A Python library (v1.0.0) designed to load, parse, and provide easy programmatic access to the UCP-LLM JSON files generated by the HTML tool.
    *   It expects JSON files with English keys (as produced by the generator).
    *   Provides getter methods for all defined sections and fields.
    *   **Installation (Future - PyPI):** `pip install ucp-llm`
    *   **Usage Example:**
        ```python
        from ucp_llm import UCPProfile

        profile = UCPProfile("path/to/your_ucp_llm_protocol.json")
        if profile.is_valid():
            print(f"Generator Tool Version: {profile.get_generator_tool_version()}")
            print(f"Preferred Name: {profile.get_personal_preferred_name()}")
            projects = profile.get_all_projects_objectives()
            if projects:
                print(f"First Project: {profile.get_value_from_item(projects[0], 'projectOrObjectiveTitle')}")
        else:
            print(f"Error: {profile.get_error()}")
        ```

4.  **üñ•Ô∏è `UCP-LLM Profile Manager` (Python Tkinter GUI Application):**
    *   **(Located in `/ucp_llm_gui_manager/ucp_llm_profile_manager.py`)**
    *   A desktop GUI application (v1.0.0) built with Python and Tkinter.
    *   Uses the `ucp_llm` library to:
        *   Load existing UCP-LLM JSON files.
        *   Display the protocol content in a structured, human-readable format (with English labels).
        *   Allow users to **edit** the values of the protocol fields.
        *   Save the modified protocol back to a JSON file.
        *   Export the protocol as a formatted text file (with English labels).
    *   **Running the GUI:** Requires Python and Tkinter installed. Execute `python ucp_llm_profile_manager.py`.

## üî© Expected JSON Structure (Brief Overview)

The `UCP-LLM Generator.html` tool produces a JSON file with the following general structure:

{
  "protocolVersion": "UCP-LLM Generator v1.0.0",
  "generationDate": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "personal", // Unique English ID for the section
      "title": "üë§ Personal Data", // English display title
      "items": [
        {
          "preferredName": "User's Value", // English Key
          "dateOfBirth": "User's Value",
          // ... other English keys and their values
        }
      ]
    },
    // ... other sections
    {
      "id": "projects",
      "title": "üìå Projects & Objectives",
      "items": [ // Can have multiple items
        { "projectOrObjectiveTitle": "Project Alpha", /* ... */ },
        { "projectOrObjectiveTitle": "Objective Beta", /* ... */ }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

üî≠ Future Goals & Roadmap

This is the foundational version (v1.0.0). Future development aims to include:

"Eve" - Intelligent Assistant: A conversational AI (potentially integrated within the generator or a separate platform) to help users build their UCP-LLM through dialogue rather than form-filling.

Advanced Platform Features:

Cloud-based UCP-LLM storage and management.

Protocol analysis tools (e.g., identifying inconsistencies, value patterns).

More sophisticated versioning and diffing of protocols.

Deeper LangChain/LlamaIndex Integration: More dedicated components or loaders for easier integration of UCP-LLM into LLM application frameworks.

NOUB Game Integration: Leveraging UCP-LLM to create personalized and adaptive experiences within the planned "NOUB" educational game.

Enhanced Multilingual Support: Full and dynamic multilingual support for the UI of all tools and for the protocol content itself.

Community & Standardisation: Fostering a community and potentially working towards a more standardized UCP-LLM format.
